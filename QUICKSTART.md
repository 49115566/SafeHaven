## ⚙️ Environment Configuration

- **Backend**: Configure AWS credentials and region
- **Dashboard**: AWS Location Service integrated (no additional config needed)
- **Mobile**: AWS Location Service integrated (no additional config needed)

## 🏆 Hackathon-Ready Features

### Backend (AWS Serverless)
- ✅ Authentication endpoints (login, register, verify)
- ✅ Shelter management (CRUD operations)
- ✅ Real-time notifications (SNS/SQS)
- ✅ DynamoDB data layer
- ✅ API Gateway integration

### Mobile App (React Native + Expo)
- ✅ Redux store for state management
- ✅ Authentication screens
- ✅ Shelter status update interface
- ✅ Emergency alert system
- ✅ Offline capability foundation

### Dashboard (React TypeScript)
- ✅ Responder dashboard layout
- ✅ Real-time shelter monitoring
- ✅ Map integration ready
- ✅ Tailwind CSS styling
- ✅ Authentication flow

### Shared Types
- ✅ Consistent TypeScript interfaces
- ✅ API response definitions
- ✅ WebSocket message types

## 🎯 Development Focus Areas

1. **Authentication**: JWT implementation (basic structure ready)
2. **Real-time Features**: WebSocket connections for live updates
3. **Maps Integration**: AWS Location Service with MapLibre GL JS
4. **Notification System**: Push notifications and SMS alerts
5. **Data Models**: Complete DynamoDB schema implementation

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **AWS Credentials**: Run `aws configure` if backend deployment fails
- **Node Version**: Ensure Node.js 18+ is installed
- **Expo CLI**: Install globally for mobile development
- **Port Conflicts**: Backend uses :3000, Dashboard uses :3001

### Getting Help
- Check `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` for detailed development guide
- Review `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` for common issues
- Each component has its own README with specific instructions

## ✅ Verification

Run this to verify everything is working:
```bash
./scripts/verify-setup.sh
```

## 🏆 Ready to Win!
