# Sprint 1 Backlog - SafeHaven Connect
## Breaking Barriers Hackathon 2025

**Sprint Duration:** 16 hours (September 19-20, 2025)  
**Sprint Goal:** Establish working end-to-end infrastructure with basic authentication and status update functionality  
**Team:** SaveHaven (Ryan Chui, Craig Truitt, Muxin Ge, Rashedul Islam Seum)

---

## üìä Infrastructure Assessment Summary

### ‚úÖ **Existing Assets (Strong Foundation)**
- **Backend**: Serverless infrastructure deployed with Lambda functions, API Gateway, DynamoDB tables
- **API Endpoints**: REST endpoints for auth, shelters, alerts, and location services
- **Database Schema**: DynamoDB tables for Shelters, Users, Alerts with proper schemas
- **AWS Location Service**: Map and Place Index resources configured
- **Mobile App**: React Native with Expo, Redux store, navigation structure
- **Dashboard**: React TypeScript with Tailwind CSS, AWS Location Map component
- **Shared Types**: Consistent TypeScript interfaces across all applications

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical Gaps Identified**
- **Authentication**: Mock implementations need real JWT logic
- **WebSocket**: Infrastructure exists but disabled, needs activation
- **Mobile Screens**: Placeholder components need full implementation
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket clients not implemented
- **Data Integration**: Frontend apps not connected to backend APIs
- **Error Handling**: Limited error boundaries and validation
