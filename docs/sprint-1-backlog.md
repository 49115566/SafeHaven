## 🎯 Sprint Success Metrics

### **Functional Metrics:**
- ✅ End-to-end demo working (Shelter login → Status update → Backend API integration)
- ✅ Authentication working on mobile with demo capability
- ✅ Real-time updates infrastructure ready (WebSocket + mobile integration)
- ⚠️ Map displaying shelter data correctly (dashboard integration pending)
- ✅ Mobile app navigates properly offline with sync capabilities

### **Technical Metrics:**
- ✅ No critical bugs blocking core functionality
- ✅ API response times optimized with proper error handling
- ✅ WebSocket connection stability with comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Mobile app loads < 3 seconds with demo data
- ⚠️ Dashboard loads < 5 seconds (real-time integration pending)

### **Quality Metrics:**
- ✅ Error handling prevents crashes with comprehensive Toast notifications
- ✅ User feedback clear and actionable via Toast system
- ✅ Consistent UI/UX with Material Design principles
- ✅ Code follows TypeScript best practices with proper type safety

## 🚧 Risk Management

### **High Risk Items:**
1. **WebSocket Implementation Complexity**
   - **Mitigation:** Start early, have HTTP polling fallback
   - **Owner:** Craig Truitt

2. **AWS Location Service Configuration**
   - **Mitigation:** Test early, have static map fallback
   - **Owner:** Muxin Ge

3. **Mobile-Backend Integration**
   - **Mitigation:** Parallel development with mock APIs
   - **Owner:** Rashedul Islam Seum

### **Medium Risk Items:**
1. **Real-time Performance**
   - **Mitigation:** Simple initial implementation, optimize later
   
2. **Authentication Complexity**
   - **Mitigation:** Basic JWT implementation, enhance later

### **Contingency Plans:**
- If WebSocket fails: Use HTTP polling every 10 seconds
- If real-time fails: Use manual refresh button
- If mobile auth fails: Skip auth for demo
- If map fails: Use simple list view
