   - **Owner:** Craig Truitt

2. **AWS Location Service Configuration**
   - **Mitigation:** Test early, have static map fallback
   - **Owner:** Muxin Ge

3. **Mobile-Backend Integration**
   - **Mitigation:** Parallel development with mock APIs
   - **Owner:** Rashedul Islam Seum

### **Medium Risk Items:**
1. **Real-time Performance**
