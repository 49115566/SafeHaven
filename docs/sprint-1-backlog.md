## 🚧 Risk Management

### **High Risk Items:**
1. **WebSocket Implementation Complexity**
   - **Mitigation:** Start early, have HTTP polling fallback
   - **Owner:** Craig Truitt

2. **AWS Location Service Configuration**
   - **Mitigation:** Test early, have static map fallback
   - **Owner:** Muxin Ge

3. **Mobile-Backend Integration**
   - **Mitigation:** Parallel development with mock APIs
   - **Owner:** Rashedul Islam Seum

### **Medium Risk Items:**
1. **Real-time Performance**
   - **Mitigation:** Simple initial implementation, optimize later
   
2. **Authentication Complexity**
   - **Mitigation:** Basic JWT implementation, enhance later

### **Contingency Plans:**
- If WebSocket fails: Use HTTP polling every 10 seconds
- If real-time fails: Use manual refresh button
- If mobile auth fails: Skip auth for demo
- If map fails: Use simple list view
