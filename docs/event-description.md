About the event  
In collaboration with AT\&T and Deloitte, AWS is hosting an innovative developer challenge focused on transforming the future of networks through agents and generative AI. This three-day hackathon, hosted on Southern Methodist University’s campus, will unite the Dallas-based community of students, startups, and enterprises to develop ideas that may shape the future of FirstNet, America’s largest network for first responders.  
**Challenge 1 | Network Intelligence Enhancement**  
Develop an innovative solution that leverages AI technologies (LLMs, Digital Twins, and Intelligent Agents) to optimize FirstNet's network performance and resource allocation. Examples include:  
• Create predictive models for network demand during emergencies  
• Implement smart load balancing using digital twin simulation  
• Enable autonomous network optimization through AI agents  
• Enhance network resilience and efficiency during critical situations  
**Challenge 2 | Community Safety & Health Innovation**  
Design a novel application or service that utilizes FirstNet's dedicated public safety network to enhance community well being and emergency response. Examples include:  
• Connect first responders with real-time health/safety data  
• Enable faster coordination between emergency services  
• Improve disaster preparedness and response  
• Create new ways for communities to interact with emergency services
