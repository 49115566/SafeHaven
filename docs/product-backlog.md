## 9. Risk Management

### 9.1 Technical Risks

#### HIGH RISK: WebSocket Implementation Complexity
**Probability:** Medium | **Impact:** High
**Risk:** Real-time communication may be complex to implement within timeline
**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Start with simple polling, upgrade to WebSocket if time allows
- Use established libraries (Socket.IO) instead of raw WebSocket
- Prepare fallback to HTTP polling for real-time updates
- Dedicate most experienced developer to this task

**Contingency Plan:**
- If WebSocket fails, implement 5-second polling intervals
- Show "last updated" timestamps to users
- Manual refresh button as backup

#### MEDIUM RISK: AWS Location Service Integration
**Probability:** Medium | **Impact:** Medium
**Risk:** Map integration may require complex AWS configuration
**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Pre-configure AWS Location Service resources
- Use existing AwsLocationMap component as starting point
- Prepare static map fallback with basic markers
- Test AWS credentials and permissions early

**Contingency Plan:**
- Use OpenStreetMap or Google Maps as fallback
- Implement basic coordinate plotting without advanced features
- Focus on functionality over map aesthetics

#### MEDIUM RISK: Mobile App Deployment
**Probability:** Low | **Impact:** High
**Risk:** React Native app may have deployment or device-specific issues
**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Test on multiple devices early and often
- Use Expo for simplified deployment and testing
- Prepare web version of mobile app as backup
- Document device-specific requirements

**Contingency Plan:**
- Demo using iOS Simulator/Android Emulator
- Create responsive web version that works on mobile browsers
- Focus on core functionality over native features

### 9.2 Timeline Risks

#### HIGH RISK: Feature Scope Creep
**Probability:** High | **Impact:** High
**Risk:** Team may attempt to implement too many features
**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Strict adherence to P0/P1 priority classification
- Hourly progress reviews and scope adjustments
- Pre-defined feature cuts if timeline slips
- Focus on demo impact over feature completeness

**Scope Reduction Plan:**
1. First cut: Remove P2 and P3 features
2. Second cut: Simplify authentication (hardcoded users)
3. Third cut: Remove offline functionality
4. Final cut: Static demo data only

#### MEDIUM RISK: Integration Challenges
**Probability:** Medium | **Impact:** High
**Risk:** Frontend-backend integration may take longer than expected
**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Define API contracts early and stick to them
- Use mock data in frontends until APIs are ready
- Parallel development with clear interfaces
- Daily integration testing

**Integration Fallback:**
- Prepare mock API responses for demo
- Use static data with simulated real-time updates
- Focus on UI/UX demonstration over live functionality

### 9.3 Team Coordination Risks

#### MEDIUM RISK: Knowledge Transfer Gaps
**Probability:** Medium | **Impact:** Medium
**Risk:** Team members may not understand other components well enough for integration
**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Daily stand-ups with technical details sharing
- Shared documentation in real-time (Google Docs)
- Pair programming for complex integrations
- Code reviews for knowledge sharing

**Knowledge Sharing Plan:**
- Ryan: Full-stack coordination and DevOps
- Craig: Backend APIs and AWS infrastructure
- Muxin: Dashboard frontend and real-time features
- Rashedul: Mobile app and user experience

### 9.4 Risk Monitoring

**Daily Risk Assessment Questions:**
1. Are we on track to complete P0 features?
2. Do all team members understand their dependencies?
3. Have we tested integration points today?
4. Are there any blocking technical issues?
5. Is the demo scenario still realistic?

**Risk Escalation Process:**
- **Green**: On track, no action needed
- **Yellow**: Minor delays, adjust sprint scope
- **Red**: Major risk, implement contingency plan
